      About The Application</h2>
      <section><h3>Abstract</h3><p>Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a given place and time in regards to heat, cloudiness,
sunshine, wind, and rain. Of all the geophysical phenomena weather is the most significant one that
influences us. Weather can vary greatly and largely depends on climate, seasons and various other
factors. The chief goal of this projectis to get the weather of any city throughout the world through
an web-based live application . We say live application as we get live weather updates for a
particular city. It uses OpenWeatherAPI which has APIs for weather reports of many cities all
around the globe. With JavaScript we are interacting with API to produce the weather at a place.</p></section>
      <section><h3>Problem Statement</h3><p>This project is to create a Web-Based Weather Application which enable user to get weather of current location or any other location that user promptts.It is developed to get instant weather updates.It is very simple application to use and can be run anywhere on the internet.</p></section>
      <section><h3>Title CSZ?</h3><p>CSZ stands for C : Chanakya , S : Sunny , Z : Zaaki. Tagline of our application is "What's Your Weather".</p></section>
