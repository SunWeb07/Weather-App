      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a given place and time in regards to heat, cloudiness, sunshine,
        wind, and rain. Of all the geophysical phenomena weather is the most significant one that influences us. Weather
        can vary greatly and largely depends on climate, seasons and various other factors. The chief goal of this
        projectis to get the weather of any city throughout the world through an web-based live application . We say
        live application as we get live weather updates for a particular city. It uses OpenWeatherAPI which has APIs for
        weather reports of many cities all around the globe. With JavaScript we are interacting with API to produce the
        weather at a place.</p>
